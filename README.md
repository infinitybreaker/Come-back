# Come-back
This project is a come back to the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I mostly worked on Web development projects as an Intern, building some basic backend functionalities and integrating some components here and there. So, I finally decided to go solo and start with the basics of frontend development.

Here is the course I am following, to make strong building blocks for the same.
